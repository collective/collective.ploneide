title="viewletManager"
help_text="A directive to register a new viewlet manager. Viewlet manager registrations are very similar to content provider registrations, since they are just a simple extension of content providers. However, viewlet managers commonly have a specific provided interface, which is used to discriminate the viewlets they are providing."
