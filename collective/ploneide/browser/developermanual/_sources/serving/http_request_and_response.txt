.. admonition:: Description

    Accessing and manipulating Zope's HTTP request and response objects programmatically.

.. contents :: :local:

Introduction
============

This chapter explains the basics of Zope HTTP requests and responses:

* request and response objects lifecycle;
* data which can be extracted from the request;
* data which can be placed on the response.

Lifecycle
=========

Unlike some other web frameworks, in Plone you do not explictly create or
return HTTP response objects.  A HTTP request object always has a HTTP response
object associated with it, and the response object is created as soon as the
request hits the webserver.

The response is available for the whole lifetime of request processing.  This
effectively allows you to set and modify response headers at any point in the
code.

Webservers
==========

Usually Plone runs on Zope's ZServer_ (based on Sam Rushing's Medusa_). Other
alternatives are WSGI_ compatible web servers like Repoze_.

The web server will affect how your HTTP objects are constructed.


HTTP Request
============

All incoming HTTP requests are wrapped in Zope's ZPublisher_ HTTPRequest_
objects. This is a multi-mapping: it contains mappings for environment
variables, other variables, form data, and cookies, but the keys of all these
mappings can also be looked up directly on the request object (i.e.
``request['some_form_id']`` and ``request.form['some_form_id']`` are
equivalent).

Usually your view function or instance will receive an HTTP request object,
along with a traversed context, as its construction parameter.

You can access the request in your view::

    from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView

    class SampleView(BrowserView):

        def __init__(self, context, request):
            # Each view instance receives context and request as construction parameters
            self.context = context
            self.request = request

        def __call__(self):
            # Entry point of request processing
            # Dump out incoming request variables
            print self.request.items()

Request method
--------------

The request method (GET or POST) can be read::

  request["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST" # or "GET"


Request URL
-----------

To get the requested URL::

    >>> request["ACTUAL_URL"]
    'http://localhost:8080/site'

To get the URL of the served object use the following (this might be different
from the requested URL, since Plone does all kinds of default page and default
view magic)::

    >>> request["URL"]
    'http://m.localhost:8080/site/matkailijallefolder/@@frontpage'

.. note ::

        URLs, as accessed above, do not contain query string.

Query string
------------

The unparsed query string can be accessed.

E.g. if you go to ``http://localhost:8080/site?something=foobar``::

    >>> self.request["QUERY_STRING"]
    'something=foobar'

If the query string is not present in the HTTP request, it is an empty string.

.. note ::

    You can also use the ``request.form`` dictionary to access parsed query
    string content.

Request path
------------

The request URI path can be read from ``request.path``, which returns a list of
path components.  ``request.path`` is a virtual path, and has the site id
component removed from it.

Example::

    reconstructed_path = "/".join(request.path)

Other possible headers::

    ('PATH_INFO', '/plonecommunity/Members')
    ('PATH_TRANSLATED', '/plonecommunity/Members')

.. TODO: What's the difference?

``REQUEST_URI``
----------------

To get the variable which corresponds to ``REQUEST_URI`` in e.g. PHP the
following helps::

    # Concatenate the user-visible URL and query parameters
    full_url = request.ACTUAL_URL + "?" + request.QUERY_STRING
    parsed = urlparse.urlsplit(full_url)

    # Extract path part and add the query if it existed
    uri = parsed[2]
    if parsed[3]:
        uri += "?" + parsed[3]


For more information, see:

* http://www.teamrubber.com/blog/_serverrequest_uri-in-zope/

* http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/urlparse/index.html

Request client IP
-------------------

Example::

    def get_ip(request):
        """ Extract the client IP address from the HTTP request in a proxy-compatible way.

        @return: IP address as a string or None if not available
        """
        if "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR" in request.environ:
            # Virtual host
            ip = request.environ["HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR"]
        elif "HTTP_HOST" in request.environ:
            # Non-virtualhost
            ip = request.environ["REMOTE_ADDR"]
        else:
            # Unit test code?
            ip = None

        return ip

For more information, see:

* http://wiki.zope.org/zope2/ZopeAndApache#setting-remote-addr-to-the-client-ip

``GET`` variables
-------------------

HTTP ``GET`` variables are available in ``request.form`` if the ``REQUEST_METHOD`` was ``GET``.

Example::


    # http://yoursite.com/@@testview/?my_param_id=something
    print self.request.form["my_param_id"]

``POST`` variables
---------------------

HTTP ``POST`` varibles are available in ``request.form``::

    print request.form.items() # Everything POST brought to us

There is no difference in accessing ``GET`` and ``POST`` variables.

HTTP headers
------------

HTTP headers are available through ``request.get_header()`` and the
``request.environ`` dictionary.

Example::

    referer = self.request.get_header("referer") # Page referer (the page from user came from)

    if referer == None: # referer will be none if it was missing
        pass

Dumping all headers::

    for name, value in request.environ.items():
        print "%s: %s" % (name, value)

Query string
------------

To access the raw HTTP ``GET`` query string::

    query_string = request["QUERY_STRING"]


Web environment
---------------

The web server exposes its own environment variables in ``request.other``
(ZServer_) or ``request.environ`` (Repoze_ and other WSGI_-based web servers)::

    print request.other.items()

    user_agent = request.other["HTTP_USER_AGENT"]

    user_agent = request.environ["HTTP_USER_AGENT"] # WSGI or Repoze server

Hostname
---------

Below is an example to get the HTTP server name in a safe manner, taking
virtual hosting into account::

    def get_hostname(request):
        """ Extract hostname in virtual-host-safe manner

        @param request: HTTPRequest object, assumed contains environ dictionary

        @return: Host DNS name, as requested by client. Lowercased, no port part.
                 Return None if host name is not present in HTTP request headers
                 (e.g. unit testing).
        """

        if "HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST" in request.environ:
            # Virtual host
            host = request.environ["HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST"]
        elif "HTTP_HOST" in request.environ:
            # Direct client request
            host = request.environ["HTTP_HOST"]
        else:
            return None

        # separate to domain name and port sections
        host=host.split(":")[0].lower()

        return host

Request port
------------

It is possible to extract the Zope instance port from the request.  This is
useful e.g. for debugging purposes if you have multiple ZEO front ends running,
and you want to identify them easily::

    port = request.get("SERVER_PORT", None)

.. note ::

    The ``SERVER_PORT`` variable returns the port number as a string, not an integer.

.. note ::

    This port number is not the one visible to the external traffic (port 80, HTTP)

Flat access
-----------

``GET``, ``POST`` and web environment variables are flat mapped
to the request object as a dictionary look up::

    # Comes from POST
    request["input_username"] == request.form["input_username"]

    # Comes from environ
    request.get('HTTP_USER_AGENT') == request.environ["HTTP_USER_AGENT"]

Request mutability
------------------

Even if you can write and add your own attributes to HTTP request objects, this
behavior is discouraged. If you need to create cache variables for request
lifecycle use annotations_. 

.. TODO: Add link to internal annotations examples when written.


Accessing HTTP request outside context
=======================================

There are often cases where you would like to get hold of the HTTP request
object, but the underlying framework does not pass it to you.  In these cases
you have two ways to access the request object:

* Use *acquisition* to get the request object from the site root. When Plone
  site traversal starts, the HTTP request is assigned to current site object
  as the ``site.REQUEST`` attribute.

* Use http://pypi.python.org/pypi/five.globalrequest.

Example of getting the request using acquisition::

    # context is any traversed Plone content item
    request = getattr(context, "REQUEST", None)
    if request is not None:
        # Do the normal flow
        ...
    else:
        # This code path was not initiated by an incoming web server request
        # Handle cases like
        # - command line scripts
        # - add-on installer
        # - code called during Zope start up
        # -etc.
        ...

zope.globalrequest.getRequest
---------------------------------

See 

* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/five.globalrequest


HTTP response
=============

Usually you do not return HTTP responses directly from your views. Instead, you
modify the existing HTTP response object (associated with the request) and
return the object which will be HTTP response payload.

The returned payload object can be:

* a string (str) 8-bit raw data; or 
* an iterable: the response is streamed, instead of memory-buffered.

Accessing response
------------------

You can access the HTTP response if you know the request::

    from Products.Five.browser import BrowserView

    class SampleView(BrowserView):

        def __init__(context, request):
            # Each view instance receives context and request as construction parameters
            self.context = context
            self.request = request

        def __call__(self):
            response = self.request.response
            return "<html><body>Hello world!</body></html>"

Response headers
----------------

Use HTTPResponse_ ``setHeader()`` to set headers::

     # The response is a dynamically generated image
     self.request.response.setHeader("Content-type", "image/jpeg")
     return image_data

Content disposition
-------------------

The ``Content-Disposition`` header is used to set the filename of a download.
It is also used by Flash 10 to check whether Flash download is valid.

Example of setting the download and downloadable filename::

    response = self.request.response
    response.setHeader("Content-type", "text/x-vCard; charset=utf-8")
    response.setHeader("Content-Transfer-Encoding", "8bit")

    cd = 'attachment; filename=%s.vcf' % (context.id)
    response.setHeader('Content-Disposition', cd)

For more information, see:

* http://www.littled.net/new/2008/10/17/plone-and-flash-player-10/ 
* http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260519

Return code
-----------

Use ``HTTPResponse.setStatus(self, status, reason=None, lock=None)``
to set HTTP return status ("404 Not Found", "500 Internal Error", etc.).

If ``lock=True``, no further modification of the HTTPResponse are allowed,
and will fail silently.

Response body
--------------

You might want to read or manipulate the response body in the post-publication
hook.

The response body is not always a string or basestring: it can be a generator
or iterable for blob data.

The body is avaialble as the ``response.body`` attribute.

Redirects
----------

Use the ``response.redirect()`` method::

    # This will send a "302 Temporary Redirect" notification to the browser
    response.redirect(new_url)

    # This will send a "301 Permantent Redirect" notification to the browser
    response.redirect(new_url, status=301)


Middleware-like hooks
=====================

Plone does not have a middleware concept, as everything happens through traversal.
Middleware behavior can be emulated with the *before traverse* hook.
This hook can be installed on any persistent object in the traversing graph.
The hook is persistent, so it is a database change and must be installed using
custom GenericSetup Python code.

.. warning::

    Before traverse hooks cannot create new HTTP responses, or return
    alternative HTTP responses.  Only exception-like HTTP response modification
    is supported, e.g. HTTP redirects. If you need to rewrite the whole
    response, the post-publication hook must be used.

Examples:

* Redirector: https://plonegomobile.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gomobile/gomobile.mobile/gomobile/mobile/postpublication.py


Post-publication hook
=====================

The post-publication hook is run when:

* the context object has been traversed; 
* after the view has been called and the view has rendered the response; 
* before the response is sent to the browser; 
* before the transaction is committed.

This is practical for caching purposes: it is the ideal place to determine and
insert caching headers into the response.

<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.postpublicationhook/>`_.

Extracting useful information in the post-publication hook
--------------------------------------------------------------

Example::

    from zope.component import adapter, getUtility, getMultiAdapter
    from plone.postpublicationhook.interfaces import IAfterPublicationEvent
    from Products.CMFCore.interfaces import IContentish

    def get_contentish(object):
        """
        Traverse acquisition upwards until we get contentish object used for the HTTP response.
        """

        contentish = object
        while not IContentish.providedBy(contentish):
            if hasattr(contentish, "aq_parent"):
                contentish = contentish.aq_parent
            else:
                break

        return contentish


    # This must be refered in configure.zcml
    @adapter(Interface, IAfterPublicationEvent)
    def language_fixer(object, event):
        """ Redirect mobile users to mobile site using gomobile.mobile.interfaces.IRedirector.

        Note: Plone does not provide a good hook doing this before traversing, so we must
        do it in post-publication. This adds extra latency, but is doable.
        """

        request = event.request
        response = request.response

        # object can be a page template, view, whichever happens to be at the very end of traversed acquisition chain
        context = get_contentish(object)

.. XXX: ``get_contentish`` above will fail if it encounters an object without aq_parent which is not contentish.
