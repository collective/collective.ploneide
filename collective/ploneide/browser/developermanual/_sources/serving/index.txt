=================================
Serving HTTP and other protocols
=================================

Serving content from your site to your users is effectively a mechanism to translate
HTTP requests to HTTP responses.

In Plone, answering to HTTP requests can be divided to three subproblems:

* Managing the lifecycle of the HTTP request and response pair;
* publishing, by traversing the request to the target object by its URI; 
* choosing different parts of the code depending on active layers.

Plone (actually the underlying ZServer) also supports FTP and WebDAV protocols.

.. comment:: ZServer is based on Medusa, but I don't think that's really relevant.
