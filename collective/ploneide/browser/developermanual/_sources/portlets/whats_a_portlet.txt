What's a Portlet?
=================

.. admonition:: Description

        This manual covers what a developer needs to know to
        create new portlet types or customise existing ones.

Portlets are chunks of information that can be shown outside the
main area of a page. They are usually boxes of different kinds
which content editors can add, set properties of and policies for
showing.

Differences with viewlets
-------------------------

A portlet is like a viewlet but with persistent configuration (i.e.
persistent in the ZODB) and run-time changeable assignments.

Use a viewlet for:

-  General content which is always displayed, for example:
   breadcrumbs, the logo, or the footer. This is not limited to only
   visible elements but can also include CSS, javascript, etc.
   (actually, that's how ResourceRegistries work).
-  Displaying elements based on the interface provided by the
   current context.

Use a portlet when:

-  You need to specify the configuration data for an item. - i.e.
   number of entries to show.
-  You want to give the content editors a choice about when and
   where to display it.
-  You want to display it only from inside a specific folder.
-  You'd like to show it only to some groups or users - e.g. Review
   portlet only is shown to users within the Reviewers group.
