Create two buildouts. One for old Plone version (your existing buildout)
and one for new version.

Prepare the migration in old buildout.
After all preparations are done, copy Data.fs to new buildout
and run plone_migration tool there.

Clear catalog
---------------

Before moving Data.fs to new version, clear all site portal_catalog information.

Fix persistent utilities

You might need to clean up some leftovers from uninstalled 
add-ons which have not performed a clean uninstall.

Theme fixing and portal_skins
