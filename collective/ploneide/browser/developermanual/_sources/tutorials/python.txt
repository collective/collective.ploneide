Introduction
=============

`Python <http://python.org>`_ is the programming language used by 
`Plone <http://plone.org>`_ and `Zope <http://zope.org>`_.

Tutorial and language learning
===============================

* Official Python tutorial: http://docs.python.org/tutorial/

* Google Python classes:
  http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/

Plone and Zope resources
==========================

Plone resources
----------------

* `Plone Cheat Sheet <http://www.coactivate.org/projects/plonecheatsheet>`_. A
  single list of every technology you need to learn to develop with plone, why
  you need it and how to learn it. A bit out of date, but a good overview
  nonetheless.

* `Plone Trac <http://dev.plone.org/plone>`_ contains bug reports, Plone source
  code and commits. Useful when you encounter a new exception or you are
  looking for a reference how to use the API.

* `Plone source code in version control system <http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone>`_.

Zope resources
----------------

* `Zope 3 API reference <http://apidoc.zope.org/>`_. Good source for up-to-date
  Zope Python API and ZCML references.

* `Zope 2 book <http://docs.zope.org/zope2/zope2book/>`_. This describes old
  Zope 2 technologies. The book is mostly good for explaining some old things,
  but '''do not''' use it as a reference for building new things.

  The chapters on Zope Page Templates however are still the best reference.

.. TODO: hyperlink 

* `Zope source code in version control system <http://svn.zope.org/>`_.

* `Zope package guide <http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/Zope3PackageGuide>`_.

Installing Python
=================

It is not recommended to use the system-wide Python installation with Plone.
Plone may require newer or older package versions, which could conflict with
ones installed by your operating system. Installing packages to the system-wide
Python installation always requires root privileges, and you could easily hose
your box when doing Python development work.

Plone Unified Installers compile their own, preconfigured, Python interpreter.

If you are a developer, you might wish to use a custom-built Python
interpreter, which gives you more control over the configuration.
