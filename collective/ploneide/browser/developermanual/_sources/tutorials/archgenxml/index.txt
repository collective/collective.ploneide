.. admonition:: Description

        ArchGenXML is a code-generator for CMF/Plone applications ("Products").
        It currently targets the Archetypes framework. It parses UML models in
        XMI-Format (``.xmi``, ``.zargo``, ``.zuml``), created with applications
        such as ArgoUML, Poseidon or ObjectDomain. This tutorial will help you
        get started developing applications with the aid of ArchGenXML.
