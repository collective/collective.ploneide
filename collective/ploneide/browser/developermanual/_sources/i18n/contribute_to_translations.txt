    How to contribute to the Plone translations.

.. contents:: :local:

Introduction
-------------

First you need `commit access to collective repository
<http://dev.plone.org/plone.org/wiki/SubversionAccess>`_ if you want
to commit your translation.

Updating translations for Plone 4.0/4.1
-----------------------------------------

If you want to test your latest translation with non yet released
packages containing i18n fixes for Plone 4, get the buildout like
this::

    svn co https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/buildouts/plone-coredev/branches/4.0 plone4
    cd plone4
    python2.6 bootstrap.py
    bin/buildout -c experimental/i18n.cfg
    bin/instance fg

To update the buildout later::

    svn up
    rm .mr.developer.cfg
    ln -s experimental/.mr.developer.cfg
    bin/develop up -f

To update your translation, you can go there::

    cd src/plone.app.locales/plone/app/locales/

Here you have the following directories:

- *i18n/kupu* used only for Products.kupu.
  This directory is not included in plone.app.locales, it's included in
  Products.kupu. It's only kept here for convenience.
- *locales* used for core Plone translations.
- *locales-addons* used for some addons packages.
- *locales-future* used for Plone 5 packages. The po files can change really
  often. The translations will normally be merge to the locales directory when
  Plone 5 will be released. This directory is not included in plone.app.locales
  4.x releases. For developers: if you want to add a Plone 5 package to this
  directory, you can add it to the plone5 variable in *experimental/i18n.cfg*,
  don't forget to add a line in *[sources]* if it's missing.

If you do `svn info` in the locales directory, you'll see it is actually a svn external to:
https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PloneTranslations/trunk/locales

Open the po file with poedit, kbabel or any other i18n tool. For example for
French::

    poedit fr/LC_MESSAGES/plone.po

You can commit your translation from this locales directory::

    svn ci -m"Updated French translation"


Updating translations for Plone 3.3
-------------------------------------

Download the buildout::

    svn co https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/buildouts/plone-coredev/branches/3.3 plone3
    cd plone3
    python2.4 bootstrap.py
    bin/buildout -c i18n.cfg
    bin/instance fg

To update the buildout later::

    svn up
    bin/develop up -f

To update your translation, you can go to
*src/plone.app.locales/plone/app/locales/i18n*
and
*src/plone.app.locales/plone/app/locales/locales*

If you do `svn info` in the i18n directory, you'll see it is actually a svn external to:
*https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PloneTranslations/branches/3.x/i18n*
