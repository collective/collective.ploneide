Introduction
-------------

Grok is a project to give sane, easy to use, API to Zope 3 systems. 
It exists as standalone, but Plone compatible port five.grok is available for Plone 3.3 and onwards.

Benefits over using pure Zope 3 APIs

* No ZCML files or XML sit-ups needed (except bootstrapping one configure.zcml file)

* More things are automatic and less explicit hand-written code needed. E.g. template file and view class are automatically matched.

* Less code generation

Grok will automatically scan all .py files in your product and 
run registration code in them. This way you can use Python decorators
and magical classes to perform tasks which before needed to have 
hand written registration code.
