Stock Plugins
-------------

Delegating Multi Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This plugin delegates a PAS interface to some other acl_user folder, typically a "legacy" folder that implements some specific authentication functionality. For example, you can delegate the IAuthenticationPlugin interface to a legacy user folder via a Delegating Multi Plugin.

Domain Auth Helper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authenticates users based on their IP address. Has nothing to do with Windows "Domain" Authentication.

ZODB User Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ZODB-based user storage. Does authentication, enumeration and properties for users and stores its data in the ZODB.
