===================
User factory plugin
===================

.. contents :: :local:

PAS supports multiple user types. PAS contains two default user types: IBasicUser and IPropertiesUser. IBasicUser is a simple user type which supports a user id, login name, roles and domain restrictions. IPropertiedUser extends this type and adds user properties.

A user factory plugin creates a new user instance. PAS will add properties, groups and roles to this instance as part of its user creation process.

If no user factory plugin is able to create a user PAS will fall back to creating a standard PropertiedUser instance.

The IUserFactoryPlugin interface is a simple one containing a single method::

   def createUser( user_id, name ):
       """ Return a user, if possible.
       o Return None to allow another plugin, or the default, to fire.
       """

The default PAS behaviour is demonstrated by this code::

   def createUser(self, user_id, name):
       return ProperiedUser(user_id, name)
