Configuring an individual PAS plugin
====================================

.. admonition:: Description

        In addition to enabling and disabling plugins via the plugins object each plugin can also
        have its own configuration. You can access this by opening a plugin in the ZMI.

Taking the *credentials_cookie_auth* as example again you will see the screen for the *Activate* tab. This tab is mandatory and allows you to enable and disable PAS interfaces for a plugin. This corresponds to the plugin configuration we saw earlier, but does not allow you to change the ordering of different plugins for an interface. If you enable a new interface for a particular plugin, it will be activated and placed last in the list of plugins for a particular interface.

You can also go to the properties tab to edit settings specific for this plugin:

What you can configure will differ per plugin. Some plugins do not have any configurations options, others can be very complex.
