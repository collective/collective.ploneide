Introduction: Why unicode is difficult?
=========================================

Python 2.x does not make clear distinction between:

* 8-bit strings (byte data)
* 16-bit unicode strings (character data)

Developers use these two formats interchangeably, because it is so easy and
Python does not warn you about this.

However, it will only work as long as the input does not encounter any
international, non-ASCII, characters.  When 8-bit encoded string data and
16-bit raw Unicode string data gets mixed up, by being run through encoding
first, really nasty things start to happen.

sys.setdefaultencoding()
=========================

Python has a **system-wide** setting to enforce encoding of all unicode
input automatically to utf-8 when used as 8-bit string.

.. warning::

    This is a wrong way to fix things and it will break other things.
    You have been warned.

UnicodeEncodeError
==================

``UnicodeEncodeError``: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe4' in position 4: ordinal not in range(128)

This is usually because you are trying to output/store unicode data using
outdated methods, e.g.

* printing,
* logging,
* using 7-bit ids ...

Instead of::

    print foo

do::

    print foo.encode("utf-8") # You are sure this is a unicode string

Filtering example::

    def safe_print(x):
        """ Do not die on bad input when doing debug prints """
        if type(x) == str:
            print x
        else:
            print x.decode("utf-8")


UnicodeDecodeError
==================

* http://wiki.python.org/moin/UnicodeDecodeError

Safe way to ``decode()`` strings
---------------------------------

This example will accept all string input and convert it to proper
unicode strings.

Example::

    if type(value) == str:
        # Ignore errors even if the string is not proper UTF-8 or has
        # broken marker bytes.
        # Python built-in function unicode() can do this.
        value = unicode(value, "utf-8", errors="ignore")
    else:
        # Assume the value object has proper __unicode__() method
        value = unicode(value)

Infamous non-breaking Unicode space \\xa0
============================================

Press CTRL+space / AltGr space on Linux to accidentally create it.

**You can't see it.** But it breaks everything.

How to fix
----------

Example to how to fix non-breaking space characters which have ended up
in reStructuredText ``.txt`` files.  This is Unicode character code A0.

Example fix_wtf_space.py::

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    """ Fix non-breaking space characters which have ended up to reST
        .txt files.  This is Unicode character code A0.

        Press CTRL+space / AltGr space on Linux to accidentally create it.

        to upload Python egg::
