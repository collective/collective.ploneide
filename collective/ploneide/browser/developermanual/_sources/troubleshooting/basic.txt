Start Plone as foreground / debug mode
----------------------------------------

Plone runs on the top of Zope application service. Zope is a Python process and will appear
as "python ....." in your task manager process list.

Zope will report any problems with code when it is launched in foreground mode (attached to a terminal).

* Basic command-line knowledge is needed in order to proceed 

First stop Zope if it's running as a background process 

* On Windows: use Plone Control Panel or Windows Control Panel Services section to shutdown Plone first

* On Linux: use /etc/init.d/plone stop or related command to shutdown Plone 

Use the command

.. code-block:: console

        bin/instance fg
        
or Windows command-line command (note that Plone location may depend on where you installed it)

.. code-block:: console
        
        cd "C:\Program files\Plone" 
        bin\instance.exe fg
        
to start Plone.
                      
All errors will be printed into the terminal. 
The error is printed as Python *traceback*. It is important to copy-paste all lines of this traceback,
not just the last line.

If there is no start up error you will see the line
