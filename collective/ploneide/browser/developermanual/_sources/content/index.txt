In Plone, User editable objects are content objects. Content objects have different flavours
depending on their type.

Examples:

* Pages (ATDocument class)

* Images (ATImage class)

* News items

* Events

* etc.

There are two different subsystems to create content objects in Plone

* Archetypes (Plone 2.x and Plone 3.x)

* Dexterity (Plone 4.x and Plone 3.x)
