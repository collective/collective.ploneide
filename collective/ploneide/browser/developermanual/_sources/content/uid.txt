Unique identifiers (UIDs)
-------------------------

UID is a unique, non-human-readable identifier for a content object which stays
on the object even if the object is moved.

Plone uses UIDs for

* Storing content-to-content references (Archetypes, ReferenceField)

* Linking by UIDs (Kupu) - this enables persistent links even though the object is moved

.. warning::

	Dexterity content framework does not use UIDS, but integer ids (intids)
	to manage references.

* `More information about Dexterity reference system <http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/manual/developer-manual/referencemanual-all-pages>`_

Getting the object's UID
------------------------

Use UID() accessor function:

	>>> site.events.UID()
	'ce380ef0f10a85beb864025928e1819b'


Looking up object by UID
-------------------------

Use lookupObject() in reference catalog.

	>>> site.reference_catalog.lookupObject('ce380ef0f10a85beb864025928e1819b')
	<ATBTreeFolder at /test/events>

*None* will be returned if there is content item with matching UID (the item has been deleted).
