Introduction
------------

Manipulating objects depends on whether they are Archetypes subsystem based or
Dexterity subsystem based.

For more information, consult the subsystem manual.

* `Archetypes examples <http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/manipulating-plone-objects-programmatically/reading-and-writing-field-values>`_.

* See 'Manipulating Content Objects <http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/manual/developer-manual/reference/manipulating-content-objects>`_
  in Dexterity manual

Reindexing modified objects
---------------------------

After modifying the object, you need to reindex it to portal_catalog to update the search and listing information.

When calling reindexObject on an object, the value for "modified" in portal_catalog will be set to
the time of the reindex, regardless of the value of the modified property of the object. 

In order to store the correct value you can do an extra reindex of the object with the modified index as parameter.

First do a normal reindexObject, then call it with the modified index explicitly::

        object.reindexObject()
        object.reindexObject(idxs=['modified'])
