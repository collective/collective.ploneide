Checking whether a File field has uploaded content
----------------------------------------------------

Calling AT File field accessor will return a File object::

        (Pdb) self.context.getAttachment()
        <File at /mfabrik/success-stories/case-studies/finnish-national-broadcasting-company/attachment>

Note that this may return None if the content item has been constructed, but the form has not 
been properly saved.
        
If size is 0 file is not yet uploaded::

        (Pdb) attach.getSize()
        0
        
Example how to check in a view whether AT context file size exists::

    @property
    def available(self):
        
        # Make sure that we have content item of right kind
        if ICaseStudy.providedBy(self.context):
        
            # Make sure the content item is not anymore in the creation stage
            if self.context.getAttachment() is not None:
            
                # Check the content of File field
                if self.context.getAttachment().getSize() > 0:
                    return True
                
        return False
