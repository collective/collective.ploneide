 Locked content
=================

Since Plone 3.1 content edit locking has been supported. This feature
is to prevent simultanous conflicting edits of the same content.

If the editor forgot to press Save or Cancel
explict unlocking must be perfomed on locked objects if you want to modify them.
Unfortunately the side-effect is that if site has objects left to locked state
they usually interfere with your programming.

Since Plone 3.3 the feature can be disabled from the site settings.

Unlocking content
-----------------

Unlocking can be performed from the object view or edit tab.
