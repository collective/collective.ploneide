    Tips for Plone performance tuning and making your add-on product and customizations faster.

Caching
-------

For Plone 4 and onwards, see `plone.app.caching <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.caching>`_.

Optimizing ZEO and threads
---------------------------

For multicore systems, which basically all production systems nowadays are, you might want
to optimize Python threading vs. processes. You may also tune how many  
Python interpreter instructions are run before doing green thread switches in the interpreter.

Debugging slow threads in production

Memcached as session storage
----------------------------

Storing sessions in ZEO/ZODB is not scaling up since they are
very prone to raise ConflictErrors if there is considerable load
on the system.

Memcached provides more scalable session backend.

For more information, see `lovely.session add-on product <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lovely.session/0.2.2>`_.

Input/output performance of the server
--------------------------------------

Clarification::

    <mcdonc> well, the example has await at about 40X svctime.. that's pretty shitty
    <mcdonc> i mean that box was useless


Tuning complex configurations

Reducing memory usage
-----------------------

This tips are especially critical when running Plone on low-memory virtual private server (VPS).

Disable extra languages
=========================

Add PTS_LANGUAGES to buildout.cfg::

        [instance]
        ...
        environment=
            PTS_LANGUAGES=en fi

Large files

LinguaPlone and multi-lingual sites
-------------------------------------

Do not use ``LanguageIndex`` and update your LinguaPlone to version 3.1.

Sessions and performance
------------------------

Write transactions are great deal worse performance wise than read transactions.

By default, every login is a write transaction. Also, Plone needs to update
logged user in session timestamp once in a while to keep the session active.

With high amount of users you may run to many ConflictErrors (read conflicts)
with ZODB.

There are some tricks you can do here

ZServer thread count
----------------------

How many requests one ZEO front end client (ZServer can handle).

Buildout default is 2.

Adjust it::

        [client1]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ....
        zserver-threads = 5

Find good value by doing performance testing for your site.

XSendFile
------------

XSendFile is an enhancement over HTTP front end proxy protocol
which allows offloading of file uploads and downloads to the front end web server
