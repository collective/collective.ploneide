    How to deal with permissions making your code permission aware in Plone

.. contents :: :local:

Introduction
------------

Permissions control whether the logged in / anonymous users can execute code paths.

Permission check is done for

* For every view/method which is hit by incoming HTTP request (Plone automatically exports
  traversable methods over HTTP interface) 

* For every called method for :doc:`RestrictedPython scripts </security/sandboxing>`

The basic way of dealing with permissions is setting the ``permission``
attribute of view declaration. For more information see :doc:`views
</views/browserviews>`.

Checking if the logged in user has a permission
----------------------------------------------------

The following code checks whether the logged in user
has a certain permission for the some object.

.. code-block:: python

    from AccessControl import getSecurityManager
    from AccessControl import Unauthorized

    # Import permission names as pseudo-constants strings from somewhere... see security doc for more info
    from Products.CMFCore import permissions

    def some_function(self, object):


        # This will
        if not getSecurityManager().checkPermission(permissions.ModifyPortalContent, object):
            raise Unauthorized("You need ModifyPortalContent permission to edit header animations")

         # ...
         # we have security clearance here
         #

Checking if a specific role has a permission
------------------------------------------------

Example which checks if Authenticated role has a permission on a certain folder on the site using ``rolesOfPermission()``::

        def checkDBPermission(self):
                
                from zope.app.component.hooks import getSite 
                
                site = getSite()
                
                obj = site.intranet
                        
                perms = obj.rolesOfPermission("View")
                
                found = False
                
                for perm in perms:
                    if perm["name"] == "Authenticated":
                        if perm["selected"] != "": # will be SELECTED if the permission is granted
                            found = True
                            break
                
                if not found:
                    from Products.statusmessages.interfaces import IStatusMessage
                    messages = IStatusMessage(self.request)
                    messages.addStatusMessage(u"Possibe permission access problem with the intranet. Errors on creation form may happen.", type="info")


Permission Access
------------------

Object that are manageable ttw inherit of `RoleManager  <http://api.plone.org/CMF/1.5.4/private/AccessControl.Role.RoleManager-class.html>`_. API class provided by this class permit you to manage permission.

Example : 

* see all possibles  permissions 

::

   >>> object.possible_permissions()
   ['ATContentTypes Topic: Add ATBooleanCriterion', 'ATContentTypes Topic: Add ATCurrentAuthorCriterion',...

* Show the security matrix of permission

::

   >>> self.portal.rolesOfPermission('Modify portal content')
  [{'selected': '', 'name': 'Anonymous'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'Authenticated'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'Contributor'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'Editor'}, {'selected': 'SELECTED', 'name': 'GroupAdmin'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'GroupContributor'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'GroupEditor'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'GroupLeader'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'GroupMember'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'GroupReader'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'GroupVisitor'}, {'selected': 'SELECTED', 'name': 'Manager'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'Member'}, {'selected': 'SELECTED', 'name': 'Owner'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'Reader'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'Reviewer'}, {'selected': '', 'name': 'SubscriptionViewer'}]
 



Bypassing permission checks
---------------------------

The current user is defined by active security manager. In both restricted and unrestricted execution certain 
functions may do their own security checks (invokeFactory, workflow, search)
to filter out results. 

If function does its own security check, there usually a code path to execute without security check.
For example the methods below have security-aware and raw versions

* context.restrictedTraverse() vs. context.unrestrictedTraverse()

* portal_catalog.searchResults() vs. portal_catalog.unrestrictedSearchResults()

However, in certain situations you have only security-aware code path
which is blocked for the current user. You still want to execute
this code path and you are sure that it does not violate your site 
security principles. 

Below is an example how you can call any Python function and
work around the security checks by establishing a temporary
``AccessControl.SecurityManager`` under special role. 

Example::

	from AccessControl import ClassSecurityInfo, getSecurityManager
	from AccessControl.SecurityManagement import newSecurityManager, setSecurityManager
	from AccessControl.User import nobody
	from AccessControl.User import UnrestrictedUser as BaseUnrestrictedUser
	
	class UnrestrictedUser(BaseUnrestrictedUser):
	    """Unrestricted user that still has an id.
	    """
	    def getId(self):
	        """Return the ID of the user.
	        """
	        return self.getUserName()
	
	def execute_under_special_role(portal, role, function, *args, **kwargs):
	    """ Execute code under special role priviledges.
	    
	    Example how to call::
	    
	    	execute_under_special_role(portal, "Manager", 
	            doSomeNormallyNotAllowedStuff,
	            source_folder, target_folder)
	    	
	    
	    @param portal: Reference to ISiteRoot object whose access controls we are using
	    
	    @param function: Method to be called with special priviledges
	    
	    @param role: User role we are using for the security context when calling the priviledged code. For example, use "Manager".
	    
	    @param args: Passed to the function
	    
	    @param kwargs: Passed to the function 
	    """
	    
	    sm = getSecurityManager()
	    
	    try:
	        try:
	            
	            # Clone the current access control user and assign a new role for him/her
	            # Note that the username (getId()) is left in exception tracebacks in error_log
	            # so it is important thing to store 
	            tmp_user = UnrestrictedUser(
	              sm.getUser().getId(),
	               '', [role], 
	               ''
	           )
	          
	            # Act as user of the portal
	            tmp_user = tmp_user.__of__(portal.acl_users)
	            newSecurityManager(None, tmp_user)
	            
	            # Call the function
	            return function(*args, **kwargs)
	            
	        except:
	            # If special exception handlers are needed, run them here
	            raise
	    finally:
	        # Restore the old security manager
	        setSecurityManager(sm)

Catching Unauthorized
---------------------

Gracefully failing when the user does not have a permission. Example::

        from AccessControl import Unauthorized

        try:
            portal_state = context.restrictedTraverse("@@plone_portal_state")
        except Unauthorized:
            # portal_state may be limited to admin users only
            portal_state = None


Creating permissions
--------------------

You don't create permissions, they "spring into existence".
Whatever that means.

* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.autopermission/1.0b1 (Plone 3 only)

* http://n2.nabble.com/creating-and-using-your-own-permissions-in-Plone-3-tp339972p1498626.html

* http://blog.fourdigits.nl/adding-zope-2-permissions-using-just-zcml-and-a-generic-setup-profile

Assigning permissions to users (roles)
--------------------------------------

Permissions are usually assigned to roles, which are assigned to users through
the web.

To assign a permission to a role, use profiles/default/rolemap.xml:

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <rolemap>
      <permissions>
        <permission name="MyProduct: MyPermission" acquire="False">
          <role name="Member"/>
        </permission>
      </permissions>
    </rolemap> 


Manually fix permission problems
--------------------------------

In the case you fiddle with permission and manage lock out even admin user for the content (both Plone
page and raw Zope page) you can still fix the problem from :doc:`debug prompt </misc/commandline>`.

Example debug session how to set ``Access Contents Information`` back to all users::

        >>> j=app.yoursiteid.yourfolderid.problematiccontent 
        >>> import AccessControl
        >>> import Products.CMFCore.permissions
        >>> sm=AccessControl.getSecurityManager()
        >>> import transaction
        >>> anon=sm.getUser()
        >>> j.manage_permission(Products.CMFCore.permissions.AccessContentsInformation,roles=anon.getRoles())
        >>> transaction.commit()

Creating permissions
----------------------        

Define both Zope permissions in one Step in ZCML
================================================================

You can use `collective.autopermission 
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.autopermission/1.0b1>` 
(`svn repository 
<http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.autopermission>`)
and define both the Zope 2 and Zope 3 permission at once with the
<permission> zcml-directive. To do that install
collective.autopermission. Either add "collective.autopermission" to
"install_requires" in setup.py or to your buildout. Then include
collective.autopermission's configure.zcml *before* you define the
permissions *and* before you use them.  (collective.autopermission is
not required in Zope 2.12/Plone 4 anymore!)

.. code-block:: xml
  
    <configure 
      xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
      xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser">
 
      <include package="collective.autopermission" />
 
      <permission 
        id="myproduct.mypermission" 
        title="MyProduct: MyPermission"
        />
  
      <browser:page 
        for="*" 
        name="myexampleview"
        class="browser.MyExampleView"
        permission="myproduct.mypermission" 
        />

    </configure>

Now you can use the permission both as a Zope 2 permission *('MyProduct:
MyPermission')* or a Zope 3 permission *('myproduct.mypermission')*. The
only disadvantage is that you can't import the permissionstring as a
variable from permissions.py.

Define Zope 2 permissions in Python code (old style)
======================================================

If you want to protect certain actions in your product by a special permission,
you most likely will want to assign this permission to a role when the product
is installed.  You will want to use Generic Setup's rolemap.xml to assign these
permissions.  A new permission will be added to the Zope instance by calling
setDefaultRoles on it. 

However, at the time when Generic Setup is run, almost none of your code has
actually been run, so the permission doesn't exist yet.  That's why we define
the permissions in permissions.py, and call this from __init__.py:

.. code-block:: python

    # __init__.py:

    import permissions

.. code-block:: python

    # permissions.py:

    from Products.CMFCore import permissions as CMFCorePermissions
    from AccessControl.SecurityInfo import ModuleSecurityInfo
    from Products.CMFCore.permissions import setDefaultRoles

    security = ModuleSecurityInfo('MyProduct')
    security.declarePublic('MyPermission')
    MyPermission = 'MyProduct: MyPermission'
    setDefaultRoles(MyPermission, ())

When working with permissions, always use the variable name instead of the
string value.  This ensures that you can't make typos with the string value,
which are hard to debug.  If you do make a typo in the variable name, you'll
get an ImportError or NameError.

Making permission available as Zope 3 permission
=====================================================

To use your permissions with Zope 3 technologies
e.g. BrowserViews/formlib/z3c.form, you need
to make them available available as Zope 3 permissions. This is done
in ZCML using a the <permission> directive. Example configure.zcml:

.. code-block:: xml
   
    <configure 
      xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope">

      <permission 
        id="myproduct.mypermission" 
        title="MyProduct: MyPermission" 
        />
    
    </configure>

It's convention to prefix the permission id with the nmame of the
package it's defined in and use lower case only. You have to take care
that the title matches exactly the permission string you used in
permissions.py. Otherwise a different, zope 3 only, permission is
registered.

You can use the permission to e.g. protect BrowserViews. Example
configure.zcml:

.. code-block:: xml

    <configure 
      xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
      xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser">
   
      <permission 
        id="myproduct.mypermission" 
        title="MyProduct: MyPermission" />
 
      <browser:page 
        for="*" 
        name="myexampleview"
        class="browser.MyExampleView"
        permission="myproduct.mypermission" 
        />

    </configure>
