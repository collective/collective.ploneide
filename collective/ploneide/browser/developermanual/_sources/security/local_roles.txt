        Creating and setting roles of the Plone members programmatically

Introduction
-------------

Local roles allows user accounts to have special priviledges for a folder and its children.

Creating a role
---------------

Please read below how to create a new role and make it appear on
Sharing tab.

Setting local role
-------------------

manage_setLocalRoles is defined by `AccessControl.Role.RoleManager <http://svn.zope.org/Zope/trunk/src/AccessControl/Role.py?rev=96262&view=markup>`_.

Example::

    context.manage_setLocalRoles(userid, ["Local roles as a list"])
    
Getting local roles
-------------------

get_local_roles() return currently set local roles. This does not return effective roles (acquired from parent hiercarchy).
get_local_roles_for_userid() returns roles for a particular user as a tuple.

Example::

    # get_local_roles() return sequence like ( ("userid1", ("rolename1", "rolename2")), ("userid2", ("rolename1") )
    roles = context.get_local_roles()  

Deleting local roles
--------------------

manage_delLocalRoles(userids) takes *a list* of usernames as argument. All local roles
for these users will be cleared.  

The following example will reset local roles based on external input (membrane specific)::

    def _updateLocalRoles(self):
        """ Resets Local Coordinator roles for associated users. 
        
        Reads Archetypes field which is a ReferenceField to membrane users.
        Based on this field values users are granted local roles on this object.
        """
        
        # Build list of associated usernames
        usernames = []

        # Set roles for newly given users        
        for member in self.getExtraLocalCoordinators():

            # We are only interested in this particular custom membrane user type
            if member.getUserType() == "local_coordinator":
            
                username = member.getUserName()
                
                usernames.append(username)
            
                self.manage_setLocalRoles(username, ["Local Coordinator"])
                
        membrane = getToolByName(self, "membrane_tool")
                                    
        # Make sure that users which do not appear in extraLocalCoordinators
        # will have their roles cleared        
        for username, roles in self.get_local_roles():
                        
            sits_user = membrane.getUserAuthProvider(username)            
           
            if not username in usernames:
                print "Clearing:" + username
                self.manage_delLocalRoles([username])

Local role caching
------------------

Resolving effective local roles is a cumbersome operation, so the result is cached. 

**Unit test warning**: Local roles are cached per request basis. You need to clear this cache after
modifying object's local roles or switching user if you want to get proper readings.

Unit test example method::

    def clearLocalRolesCache(self):
        """ Clear borg.localroles cache.
        
        borg.localroles check role implementation caches user/request combinations.
        If we edit the roles for a user we need to clear this cache,
        """
        from zope.annotation.interfaces import IAnnotations
        ann = IAnnotations(self.app.REQUEST) 
        for key in ann.keys(): # Little destructive here, deletes *all* annotations
            del ann[key]
