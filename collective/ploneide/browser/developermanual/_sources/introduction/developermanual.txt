 How to upload Plone community developer documentation to Plone CMS
====================================================================

.. admonition:: Description

        This document explains integrating Sphinx and Plone,
        and uses the Plone Community Developer Manual and plone.org 
        site as an example.

Introduction
--------------

This concerns only those who:

* wish to generate a HTML version of Plone Community Developer manual;
* wish to upload Sphinx documentation to a Plone site.

collective.developermanual
--------------------------

collective.developermanual_ is open-for-anyone-to-edit documentation for Plone developers in Sphinx format,
living in `Plone's collective Github version control system`_ (anyone can get commit access).

.. _collective.developermanual: https://github.com/collective/collective.developermanual 
.. _Plone's collective Github version control system: https://github.com/collective

Sphinx_ is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, 
written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.

.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

collective.developermanual contains :doc:`buildout.cfg recipes </tutorials/buildout/index>` to

* Install Sphinx 
* Compile manual to HTML 
* Upload manual to a Plone site (using the ``bin/toplone`` script and ``transmogrify`` source packages) 

Upload does not need any special support from the Plone site to accept Sphinx documentation
(besides installing `Plone Help Center`_, but the pipeline can be configured to use *Folders* and *Pages*
instead of *Reference Manual* content types).  

.. _Plone Help Center: http://plone.org/products/plonehelpcenter

Setting up software for manual compilation and upload
-------------------------------------------------------

First you need to install Git for your operating system to be able to checkout necessary source code::

        sudo apt-get install git-core # Debian-based Linux
         
or::

        sudo port install git-core # Mac, using MacPorts

.. note:::

        You must not have Sphinx installed in your Python environment (``easy_install``).
        Remove it, as it will clash with the version created by buildout.
        Use ``virtualenv`` if you need to have Sphinx around for other projects.

Run buildout to install Sphinx and the necessary packages for uploading. First step: bootstrap::

        python2.6 bootstrap.py
        bin/buildout

This will always report an error, but the ``bin/`` folder is created and populated with the required scripts.
Now you need to checkout all the source code using the *Mr. Developer* tool::

        bin/develop co ""

Run buildout again::

        bin/buildout

Building static HTML with Sphinx
---------------------------------

This creates ``docs/html`` folder from the source documents in the ``source`` folder, by compiling all the ``collective.developermanual`` pages,
using ``sphinx-build`` command from buildout::

        make html 
        
If you want to build everything from the scratch, to see all warnings::

        make clean html                     

Uploading documentation to a site
---------------------------------

The ``collective.developer`` manual contains a buildout
which defines a pipeline for `collective.transmogrify <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.transmogrifier/>`_
to upload the Sphinx-generated HTML files to  Plone site
as `Plone Help Center <http://plone.org/products/plonehelpcenter>`_ *Reference Manual* content.

``collective.transmogrify`` was originally developed to provide pipelines to import,
manipulate and export content. It allows you to use a plug-in architecture 
to provide necessary steps, called *blueprints*, to pass content in a pipeline from one filter to another.
The idea is very similar to video and audio codec architectures.

Blueprints can be mix-and-matched using a ``pipeline.cfg`` configuration file.
``collective.developermanual`` defines pipelines for crawling the generated Sphinx HTML files,
breaking down the HTML to fields (title, description, body) and then uploading it to a Plone
site using Zope's XML-RPC API and URL functions, like workflow transition, exposed by Plone.
As Zope provides the necessary XML-RPC facilities, no specific code for the uploader is 
needed on the server running the Plone site. 

Setting up Plone site for uploading Sphinx documentation
=========================================================

First install the *Plone Help Center* add-on and create a *Reference Manual* 
item at the remote site.

The documentation can be uploaded to:

* any Plone site 
* with `Plone Help Center add-on <http://plone.org/products/plonehelpcenter>`_ installed.
* Sphinx-specific CSS styles can be installed (optional) for source code colorization,
  warnings, notes and other mark-up in the documentation. These are included
  as ``sphinx.css`` and it is easiest to drop them to your ``portal_skins`` layer manually.

Compiling HTML manual
=====================

Use the Sphinx makefile::

        make html

Running upload
==============

Buildout generates the ``bin/toplone`` command-line script.

Example how to upload to a local Plone instance::

        make clean html
        bin/toplone bin/toplone --ploneupload:target=http://admin:admin@localhost:8080/Plone/documentation/manual/plone-community-developer-documentation

... or in the case of Plone.org::

    bin/toplone --ploneupload:target=http://username:password@manage.plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-community-developer-documentation    

(Substitute your username and password in the URL.)

The upload script

* is generated when you run buildout (see ``buildout.cfg``);
* reconfigures the transmogrifier pipeline to use the remote site and *HTTP Basic Auth* credentials
  provided on the command line;
* crawl the Sphinx documentation and extract the title, description and body text of each page
  (In theory you could crawl any remote web site for this. The ``toplone`` script is 
  created to crawl local documentation only.);
* create *Plone Help Center* content items at the remote Plone instance using Zope's XML-RPC;
* update remote Plone items to reflect documentation changes, using Zope's XML-RPC;
* Publish items, and hide unnecessary items from the navigation (e.g. image source folders).

.. note ::

        The upload script does not currently purge the existing uploaded documentation.
        If pages have been renamed or moved, you need to delete the documentation
        on the target site before performing the upload. Just go to the
        *Reference Manual Contents* tab, select all, and hit delete.

Setting up CSS
==============

An example ``sphinx.css`` is provided with ``collective.developermanual``.

* It sets up CSS for default Sphinx styles (notices, warning, other admonition).  
* It sets up CSS for syntax highlighting.  
* It resolves some CSS class conflicts between Sphinx and the plone.org theme.

``sphinx.css`` assumes that a special Sphinx ``page.html`` template is used.
This template is modified to wrap everything which Sphinx outputs in the ``sphinx-content``
CSS class, so we can nicely separate them from standard Plone styles.

``page.html`` can be found at ``sources/_templates/page.html``.
