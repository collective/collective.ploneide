 Data models
==========================

Data models (schemas) define what fields are available on objects.

Plone has two major schema subsystems:

* The ``zope.schema`` package used by various form libraries, ZCML and
  persistent objects;

* The Archetypes ``Schema`` class used with Archetypes content.

This chapter only deals with ``zope.schema`` related issues.
