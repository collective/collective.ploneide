Converting single process instance to ZEO cluster
====================================================

.. contents :: :local:

Introduction
------------

See `ZEO <http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/installing-plone-3-with-the-unified-installer/to-zeo-or-not-to-zeo>`_.

See `plone.app.blob product page <http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob>` for good ZEO configuration example.

Steps
-----

Use link above for a buildout.cfg example.

Changes needed to single process buildout.cfg:

* Add [zeo] section

::

    [zeo]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver
    zope2-location = ${zope2:location}
    zeo-address = 127.0.0.1:8100
    zeo-var = ${buildout:directory}/var
    blob-storage = ${zeo:zeo-var}/blobstorage
    eggs = plone.app.blob


* Convert [instance] to [client1]. Add following new settings:

::
    zeo-client = on
    zeo-address =  ${zeo:zeo-address}
    # If blobs are used
    shared-blob = on

* Add [client2] ... [clientN] sections

    [client2]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    http-address = 8081
    zope2-location = ${client1:zope2-location}
    zeo-client = ${client1:zeo-client}
    zeo-address = ${client1:zeo-address}
    blob-storage = ${client1:blob-storage}
    shared-blob = ${client1:shared-blob}
    user = ${client1:user}
    products = ${client1:products}
    eggs = ${client1:eggs}
    zcml = ${client1:zcml}


* Reconfigure [buildout] parts to include zeo, client1, client2...

.. code-block:: sh

    [buildout]
    parts =
        plone
        zope2
        zeo
        client1
        client2
    # instance     ... instance is no longer required when running ZEO based instance

* Change all ${instance:...} references to ${client1:...}. Search and replace ${instance: -> ${client1


Starting ZEO cluster
--------------------

You need to start ZEO and clients independently

* bin/zeo start

* bin/client1 start

* bin/client2 state

* etc.
